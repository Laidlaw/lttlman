<Heading level={2}>
  Hi, I'm Alan Laidlaw.
</Heading>

I love building products and systems that tackle complex problems. I've been doing this for 10 years, so I've seen all sides of the product lifecycle, from multi-million dollar contracts to early stage startups.

I'm cross-disciplined by default. If there is a bottleneck in the system, in the software or the company, I gravitate toward it and shed light on it.

Most recently, that meant learning React and Elixir so that we could launch a B2B Saas application in four months.
