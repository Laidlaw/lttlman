## Hi, I'm Alan Laidlaw

I love building products and systems that tackle complex problems. I've been doing this for 10 years, so I've seen all sides of the product lifecycle, from multi-million dollar contracts to early stage startups.

I'm cross-disciplined by default. If there is a bottleneck in the system, in the software or the company, I gravitate toward it and shed light on it.

Curiousity &amp; sheer stubborness led me into web development. But I truly love working with people so I found myself moving closer to the start of the product lifecycle, where the ideas<label for="idea-generation" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="idea-generation" class="margin-toggle">

Most recently, that meant learning React and Elixir so that we could launch a B2B Saas application in four months.
